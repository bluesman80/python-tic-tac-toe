# python-tic-tac-toe
'Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe,   also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you   the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best   strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

THIS LITTLE PYTHON CODE IS WRITTEN AS THE FINAL TASK OF "TIC-TAC-TOE" PROJECT IN JETBRAINS ACADEMY.

The program does the following.
1. Prints an empty field at the beginning of the game.
2. Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a field with the changes if everything is OK.
3. Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.
